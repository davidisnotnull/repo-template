# Repo Template
Use this as a Github template to create consistent project repo structures. It contains:

* **assets folder** - any global assets that are required by the project, such as favicons, site logos, etc. go here.
* **db folder** - place the latest version of your bacpac file here, along with any SQL queries that are necessary for the project.
* **src folder** - place your project code here.
